## Nope

TBH it seemed like there was only one way to respond to the prompt so ...

 - Took a GLTF of a mannequin from turbo squid.
 - Loaded it into R3F.
 - Loaded textures of Frank from Hellraiser and Brundelfy from The Fly.
 - Passed them into the vertex shader and the fragment filter, mixed them together and distorted them according to the red in them.
 - The effect of distorting models based on colors in an image is worth playing with, some nice effects.

 - Generated textures of woods and cabins using generativeAI (its the future don't you know)
 - Yes, Raphael I know.
 - Still hate the spam tools, run by narcissistic vulture capital demons built on stolen work.
 - Hit so many prompt blocks doing this that I'm really intrigued as to what kind of films all those AI influencers genuinely think they'll be able to summon at will. 
 - Not gonna get a Hellraiser passed the puritanity filter.
 - Mixed those textures and distorted them for the back and floor.

Not really much else going on tbh?
-Tweaked the alpha of the mannequin so it appears to vanish through the wall.

If I'd carried on with it I'd have like to add in

 1.  A triggerable animation to the model so it could try and hug.
 2. Some sounds.
